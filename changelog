# Changed
* Gerald orbital impact effects!
* Enhanced conveyor placing!
    * Placing a conveyor will instead start a new belt, with a preview, place the endpoint to finish creating the belt
    * Switching items in the hotbar will cancel the conveyor placement
    * You can crouch-click to place conveyors manually
    * Conveyor lifts/chutes have been rolled into the one conveyor block
* Satellite weights rebalanced, now only light ones (16t or lighter) can be hand launched from stations
* Reworked mob breathing, a fair few more no longer require air to survive
* Smoother dust storm transitions on Duna

# Fixed
* Cascading generation on depth stone
* Rare crash on structure generation
* Gerald atmospheric effects missing
* Fluid burners consuming O2 when tank is empty
* Duplicate mixer recipes
* Floating Quackos in low gravity
