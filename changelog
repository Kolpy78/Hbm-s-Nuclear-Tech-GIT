Includes all changes and bugfixes from the latest upstream NTMain update - [X5377 - girl dinner (a bottle of whiskey and a gun)](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases/tag/1.0.27_X5377)

## Added
* Finished new nickel processing chain!
* Brine deposits on Mun and Minmus
    * For existing worlds, brine can be produced from conglomerate

## Changed
* "Open doors can now be interacted through" reverted because a lot of doors were authored without reasonable hitboxes for their open states, making them a pain in the ass to close, sorry abel
* Nickel oredict tweaked, "ferrous dust" from other mods can be processed into pure nickel via brine, and pentlandite can be used as ferrous dust!
* Improved biome ID conflict message
* Configuration for oil machines changed, now oil amounts are per planet instead, and the machines instead have multipliers to production

## Fixed
* Charging Stations now fill the last 1HE rather than running forever leaving your armor slightly uncharged
* #273 - Rocket travel with Hodgepodge installed could leave you stuck until leaving + rejoining a world
* Cryodistil power input not accepting power from connectors
* Aluminium ore shredding to regular powder instead of cryolite
* Water evaporating with CoFHCore installed
* Crash when entering Limbo
