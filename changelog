## Added
* Brine on Ike, for the Mark Watneys

## Changed
* Added 3 nickel crystals to Martian start to unstick progression (produces 6 nickel ingots/12 stainless steel ingots at minimum, enough for an alkylation unit)
* Removed templates in Martian start, they're gonna be axed and paper can be acquired via a sawmill
* Slightly tweaked Duna lowland biomes to only spawn cobble at its lowest points, so you can surface mine iron deposits again

## Fixed
* Bedrock ore losing planet data on reloading world/chunk
* Crash when breaking a tool with silk touch or fortune active
* Tool AoE breaking bedrock ore
