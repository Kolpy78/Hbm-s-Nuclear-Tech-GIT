Includes all changes and bugfixes from the latest upstream NTMain update - [X5356 - what did i do these past 3 weeks?](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases/tag/1.0.27_X5356)

## Added
* Planets/moons with many light sources now light up at night when viewed from other bodies
    * These bodies suffer planetwide blackouts during severe impacts
* Zinc crystals
* Flour - efficient production of bread from wheat

## Changed
* Biome conflicts now crash, rather than silently fuck your world up
    * Includes helpful error messages, specifically regarding Biomes O' Plenty support
    * Crash can be disabled in config if absolutely necessary, for old worlds and server operators
* All default biome IDs moved around to avoid as many conflicts with other mods as possible
* If EndlessIDs is detected, default biome IDs are incremented by 12,000 to avoid conflicts
    * Has no effect if your config file is already generated
* New chemplant recipes using air changes:
    * Xenon production removed, must be extracted from Eve or Laythe
    * Biogas requires CO2 for anaerobic production
    * Nitric acid from air must use Cryogenic Distillation Machine
    * For now, the old chemplant is still craftable and useable, and these changes will be rebalanced once it is axed

## Fixed
* Rare crash on closing an empty crate
* Coral drops unusable calcium item
* Mods that add worldgen features to the nether erroneously adding those features to atmosphereless bodies
* Rocket pad dupe
* Turbine blades cast/craft for 3 ingots but only recover 2 ingots
* Vanilla furnaces work without oxygen
