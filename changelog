Includes all changes and bugfixes from the latest upstream NTMain update - [X5334 - stalingrad, 1942](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases/tag/1.0.27_X5334)

## Added
* Industrial Greenhouse
    * Converts CO2 -> O2 via crop growth
    * Can be supplied with fertilizer for faster growing
    * Only sequesters CO2 directly into grown plant material, meaning continuous growth is required
    * Crops and trees grown regularly will also recycle air in a room!
    * Approximately 25 trees, or 200 crops will recycle all air in a room continuously, as long as they are replanted once fully grown
    * 16 ighouses should be sufficient to continuously replenish O2, or just 1 with fertilizer

## Changed
* Nuclear explosions in a vacuum now produce a sea of charged particles instead of a mushroom cloud, akin to Starfish Prime
* Air vents detect growing plants, and run on recycled air whenever possible
* Cryodistil now produces total 100mb of products from 100mb of atmospheric air, instead of varying lossy amounts

## Fixed
* Atmospheric compressor in pressurized room creating NONE fluid
* Nukes in space erroneously changing the biome to "Crater" causing visual bugs
