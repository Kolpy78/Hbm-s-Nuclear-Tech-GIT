* Moho has new plateau and lava ocean biomes
* Eve seismic plains are now the site of major faultlines
* Duna now has terraced plateaus, and smaller non-basalt caves away from basins
* New structures on Moho and Dres, keep an eye out!
    * Some of these new structures may have destroyed versions of highly valuable machines that can be repaired on the cheap

## Changed

* Hand-held drills have new item textures

## Fixed

* OC support in many machines returned
* Orbital station cores can no longer be destroyed, even in creative
* Hell rads were being applied on planets with no atmosphere (now they only have solar rads, as intended)
